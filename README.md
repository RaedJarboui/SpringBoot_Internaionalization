# SpringBoot_Internationalization
content translation module
The project consists of designing, developing and implementing a configurable module for translating content into different languages.
we will use an approach like the dictionary to retrieve the data and assign translation values for the data.
For table types there are normal type tables which have columns like: integer, character string, boolean, date..etc
there are tables from another third party system which have json type columns as a table structure.
and finally tables that are relational to each other.
All these tables stored in the database will be treated according to their type.
These tables will be divided into two categories: translatable tables, that is to say the administrator can access the content and add the translation of the values and the non-translatable tables.
